## Documentation Guidelines

- Do NOT create documentation files (CHANGES.md, SUMMARY.md, INSTALL.md, USAGE.md, etc.) unless explicitly requested
- Do NOT create guides, tutorials, or how-to files
- After implementing changes, provide a brief verbal summary instead of creating files
- Focus only on code changes requested
- Keep documentation to code comments only
- do not create code comments as a way of documenting code behavior

## RULE VIOLATIONS
If I violate any rule:
1. I MUST acknowledge the violation
2. I MUST delete/undo the violation
3. I MUST explain which rule was broken
4. I MUST ask how to proceed correctly

## REQUIRED WORKFLOW

Every task follows this pattern:
1. 🔍 Analyze the request
2. 💡 Present 2-3 options
3. ⏸️ STOP and wait for user choice
4. 📝 Show preview of changes
5. ⏸️ STOP and wait for approval
6. 🔧 Make changes
7. 💬 Verbal summary ONLY (no docs!)

### TWO-PHASE APPROVAL REQUIRED

Phase 1: Option Selection
- User chooses an option (e.g., "option 1", "option 2")
- This is NOT approval to implement

Phase 2: Implementation Approval  
- I MUST show detailed preview of ALL changes
- I MUST list every file that will be modified/created
- I MUST ask: "Shall I proceed? (yes/no)"
- ONLY these words approve implementation: "yes", "proceed", "go ahead", "do it", "make the changes"

### FORBIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS
- ❌ Option selection ≠ Implementation approval
- ❌ "option X" ≠ "yes, proceed"
- ❌ Enthusiasm ≠ Permission
- ❌ NEVER assume approval - ALWAYS ask explicitly

### MANDATORY CHECKLIST BEFORE ANY FILE OPERATION
Before edit_file/create_file/delete_file, I MUST verify:
- [ ] Showed complete preview of changes
- [ ] Asked "Shall I proceed?"
- [ ] Received explicit approval keyword (yes/proceed/go ahead/do it)
- [ ] NOT just option selection ("option 1" is NOT approval)
