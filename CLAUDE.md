# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Zed editor extension that provides Laravel development support, similar to the Laravel VSCode extension. The extension is written in Rust and aims to provide features such as:

- Clickable "go-to-definition" for Blade templates
- Clickable "go-to-definition" for Livewire components
- Clickable "go-to-definition" for Flux components
- Other Laravel-specific IDE features

**Important**: This is a learning project. The developer is learning Rust while building this extension, so explanations of Rust concepts, providing options, and teaching best practices are essential.

## Development Commands

Zed extensions are typically developed using:

```bash
# Build the extension (assuming standard Rust project)
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code without building
cargo check

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Build for release
cargo build --release
```

**IMPORTANT - Binary for Local Development:**
The `.zed/settings.json` configures Zed to use the local build directly:
```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "laravel-lsp": {
      "binary": {
        "path": "laravel-lsp/target/release/laravel-lsp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Development workflow:
```bash
cargo build --release
# Then in Zed: Cmd+Shift+P → "zed: reload extensions"
```

No copying or symlinks needed - Zed reads the binary path from settings.

## Running Diagnostics (Important for Zed)

When using Claude Code in Zed, it doesn't have direct access to LSP diagnostics. Always run these commands to check for errors:

### Check for Compilation Errors
```bash
cargo check
```
This is the fastest way to check if your code compiles without actually building the binary. Run this frequently while developing.

### See Detailed Compiler Messages
```bash
cargo build
```
This compiles the project and shows all errors and warnings with detailed explanations. The Rust compiler gives very helpful error messages - always read them carefully!

### Run Clippy for Best Practice Lints
```bash
cargo clippy
```
Clippy is Rust's linter that catches common mistakes and suggests more idiomatic code. Very useful when learning Rust!

### Run Tests
```bash
cargo test
```
Runs all tests in the project. Add `-- --nocapture` to see println! output during tests.

### Format Code
```bash
cargo fmt
```
Automatically formats your code according to Rust style guidelines. Run this before committing.

### Install the Extension Locally in Zed
```bash
# Install for local development/testing
zed: install dev extension
```
Use this command within Zed to load your extension for testing.

**Important**: After making changes, always run `cargo check` or `cargo build` to see if your code compiles before proceeding with more changes.

## Zed Extension Architecture

Zed extensions follow the Extension API provided by Zed. Key concepts:

- Extensions are written in Rust (or can use WebAssembly)
- Extensions interact with the Zed editor through the Extension API
- Language features like "go-to-definition" are typically implemented using the Language Server Protocol (LSP)
- Extensions can provide custom language servers or enhance existing ones

## Laravel-Specific Features to Implement

### Go-to-Definition Targets

1. **Blade Components**: `<x-component-name>` → `resources/views/components/component-name.blade.php`
2. **Livewire Components**: `<livewire:component-name>` → `app/Livewire/ComponentName.php`
3. **Flux Components**: `<flux:component>` → Flux component definition
4. **View References**: `view('view.name')` → `resources/views/view/name.blade.php`
5. **Route Names**: `route('route.name')` → route definition in `routes/` files
6. **Config References**: `config('app.name')` → `config/app.php`

## Architecture Notes

- Zed extensions MUST be written in Rust (compiled to WebAssembly)
- JavaScript/TypeScript cannot be used - VSCode extensions cannot be wrapped or ported
- Zed uses tree-sitter for syntax parsing
- May need custom tree-sitter queries for Laravel-specific patterns
- Extensions use the `zed_extension_api` crate and implement the `Extension` trait
- Language features use LSP (Language Server Protocol) integration

## LSP Architecture (laravel-lsp/)

### Core Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.rs` | LSP server, request handlers, Backend trait impl |
| `salsa_impl.rs` | Salsa incremental computation actor |
| `queries.rs` | Tree-sitter queries for pattern extraction |
| `parser.rs` | PHP and Blade tree-sitter parsing |
| `config.rs` | Laravel project configuration discovery |
| `env_parser.rs` | .env file parsing |
| `service_provider_analyzer.rs` | Middleware/binding extraction |
| `middleware_parser.rs` | Kernel.php and bootstrap/app.php parsing |

### Salsa Actor Pattern

The LSP uses a dedicated thread for Salsa incremental computation to avoid lifetime issues with async code:

```
┌─────────────────┐     oneshot channel     ┌─────────────────┐
│  LSP Handlers   │ ──────────────────────► │   SalsaActor    │
│  (async/await)  │ ◄────────────────────── │ (dedicated      │
│                 │        response         │  thread)        │
└─────────────────┘                         └─────────────────┘
```

**Key pattern for adding new Salsa features:**
1. Add `#[salsa::input]` type in `salsa_impl.rs`
2. Add data transfer type (no lifetimes) for async boundary
3. Add `SalsaRequest` variant with oneshot sender
4. Add `SalsaHandle` method (async interface)
5. Add handler method in `SalsaActor`
6. Add helper method in `main.rs` to register data

### Salsa Components

| Component | Input Type | Data Transfer Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| File Patterns | `SourceFile` | `ParsedPatternsData` | Cached parsed patterns per file |
| Config | `ConfigFile` | `LaravelConfigData` | Project configuration |
| Project Files | `ProjectFiles` | `ViewReferenceLocationData` | Reference finding across project |
| Service Providers | `ServiceProviderFile` | `MiddlewareRegistrationData`, `BindingRegistrationData` | Middleware/binding lookups |
| Env Variables | `EnvFile` | `EnvVariableData` | Environment variable lookups |

### Important Conventions

- **Data transfer types**: Use `*Data` suffix (e.g., `EnvVariableData`) for types crossing async boundaries
- **Salsa inputs**: Use `#[salsa::input]` for source data, store in `HashMap` for O(1) lookup
- **Registration pattern**: Call `register_*_with_salsa()` after successful parsing
- **Fallback pattern**: Use Salsa cache first, fall back to direct computation if unavailable
- **Priority merging**: Framework=0, Package=1, App=2 (higher wins)

### Cache Invalidation Architecture (CRITICAL)

**All file-derived features MUST use Salsa incremental computation:**

```
did_change(file) → Debounce 250ms → Update Salsa input → Queries recompute → UI updates
```

**Rules:**
1. **Never bypass Salsa** - All file parsing goes through Salsa inputs
2. **Update on edit, not just save** - Wire `did_change` to Salsa (debounced)
3. **Salsa handles invalidation** - Don't manually track what needs recomputing
4. **Pure query functions** - Queries derive from inputs, no side effects

**Pattern Types (all extracted via Salsa queries):**

| Pattern | Example | Extracted From | Target |
|---------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Views | `view('welcome')` | SourceFile | `resources/views/*.blade.php` |
| Blade Components | `<x-button>` | SourceFile | `resources/views/components/*.blade.php` |
| Blade Directives | `@include('partial')` | SourceFile | `resources/views/*.blade.php` |
| Livewire | `<livewire:counter>` | SourceFile | `app/Livewire/*.php` |
| Translations | `__('messages.key')` | SourceFile | `lang/*/*.php` |
| Assets | `asset('css/app.css')` | SourceFile | `public/*` |
| Vite | `@vite('resources/js/app.js')` | SourceFile | `resources/*` |
| Routes | `route('home')` | SourceFile | Route name in `routes/*.php` |
| Config | `config('app.name')` | SourceFile | `config/*.php` |
| Env | `env('APP_NAME')` | SourceFile | `.env` |
| Middleware | `->middleware('auth')` | SourceFile | Alias in registry |
| Bindings | `app('cache')` | SourceFile | Binding in registry |

**File Type → Salsa Input Mapping:**

| File Pattern | Salsa Input | What It Provides |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| `*.php`, `*.blade.php` | `SourceFile` | Pattern extraction (views, components, etc.) |
| `bootstrap/app.php`, `Providers/*.php` | `ServiceProviderFile` | Middleware aliases, container bindings |
| `.env`, `.env.*` | `EnvFile` | Environment variable values |
| `config/*.php`, `composer.json` | `ConfigFile` | View paths, namespaces, PSR-4 mappings |

**Target Files (existence only):**
- View files, component files, Livewire classes, translation files, assets
- Tracked via file existence cache with 5-minute TTL
- No Salsa input needed - just check if file exists

**Adding New Features:**
1. Define `#[salsa::input]` for source data
2. Define `#[salsa::tracked]` query function (pure, no side effects)
3. Ensure `did_change` updates the input (automatic via file type detection)
4. Query results are automatically cached and incrementally updated

### Request Flow Example

```
User hovers over view('users.index')
    │
    ▼
Backend::hover() in main.rs
    │
    ▼
salsa.get_parsed_patterns(file_path, content)
    │
    ▼
SalsaActor checks cache, returns ParsedPatternsData
    │
    ▼
Find matching pattern at cursor position
    │
    ▼
Resolve view name to file path using config
    │
    ▼
Return HoverContents with file location
```

## Implementation Plan

This project follows a phased approach designed for learning Rust while building:

### Phase 1: Rust & Zed Extension Basics
**Goal**: Create a minimal working Zed extension

**Learning Focus**:
- Rust project structure (`Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`)
- Basic Rust syntax (structs, traits, macros)
- The `zed_extension_api` crate
- What `impl` means and how traits work
- The `register_extension!` macro
- Rust's ownership model basics

**Deliverable**: Extension that loads in Zed and prints "Hello from Laravel Extension"

### Phase 2: File System Navigation
**Goal**: Given a view name, find the corresponding `.blade.php` file

**Learning Focus**:
- Rust's `String` vs `&str` types
- Working with file paths (`std::path::Path`)
- Result and Option types (error handling)
- Basic pattern matching with `match`
- The `?` operator for error propagation
- Why Rust doesn't have `null`

**Deliverable**: Function that converts `view('users.profile')` → `resources/views/users/profile.blade.php`

### Phase 3: Pattern Matching
**Goal**: Detect Laravel patterns in code using regex

**Learning Focus**:
- Regular expressions in Rust (`regex` crate)
- Iterators and closures
- Borrowing and references (`&` and `&mut`)
- Collections (`Vec`, `HashMap`)
- Iterator methods (`.map()`, `.filter()`, `.collect()`)

**Deliverable**: Function that finds all `view('...')` calls in a file

### Phase 4: Tree-sitter Integration
**Goal**: Parse Blade and PHP files properly using tree-sitter

**Learning Focus**:
- Working with tree-sitter's Rust API
- Tree traversal algorithms
- Lifetimes (what they are and why they matter)
- Memory management and performance
- Rust's zero-cost abstractions

**Deliverable**: Parse `<x-button>` tags from Blade files

### Phase 5: Go-to-Definition
**Goal**: Implement clickable "go-to-definition" for Blade components

**Learning Focus**:
- Zed's LSP integration APIs
- Async Rust (`async`/`await`, `Future` trait)
- More advanced trait usage
- Position/range calculations
- How async works in Rust vs JavaScript

**Deliverable**: Click `<x-button>` and jump to `components/button.blade.php`

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Extend to Livewire, Flux, routes, config

**Learning Focus**:
- Code organization (modules, workspace structure)
- Advanced error handling
- Testing in Rust (`#[cfg(test)]`)
- Documentation (`///` comments)
- Publishing extensions

**Deliverable**: Full-featured Laravel extension with multiple go-to features

## Teaching Approach

When working on this project:
1. **Explain concepts first** - Explain Rust concepts before implementing them
2. **Provide options** - Present multiple implementation approaches with trade-offs
3. **Write code together** - Explain each line as it's written
4. **Encourage questions** - Answer "why" questions about design decisions
5. **Iterative development** - Build working code first, then refactor to be "more Rusty"
6. **Help with compiler errors** - Rust's compiler is helpful; explain what errors mean

## Session State (2025-12-26)

### Last Session Summary

**Problem**: LSP was slow on startup - `parse_file_patterns` was taking ~1.8 seconds for a single `web.php` file.

**Root Cause**: The tree-sitter query (1048 lines, 31KB) was being compiled 8+ times per file - once for each `find_*` function (find_view_calls, find_env_calls, find_config_calls, etc.).

**Solution Implemented**: Single-pass extraction (Option 2 - best practice approach)

### Changes Made

1. **queries.rs** - Complete rewrite:
   - Added `once_cell::Lazy` for global query caching (compile once, reuse forever)
   - Created `ExtractedPhpPatterns` struct containing all PHP pattern types
   - Created `ExtractedBladePatterns` struct containing all Blade pattern types
   - Implemented `extract_all_php_patterns()` - single tree traversal extracts all patterns
   - Implemented `extract_all_blade_patterns()` - single tree traversal for Blade
   - Removed all individual `find_*` functions

2. **salsa_impl.rs** - Updated `parse_file_patterns`:
   - Now uses `extract_all_php_patterns()` instead of 8 separate function calls
   - Now uses `extract_all_blade_patterns()` instead of 3 separate function calls
   - Also updated `handle_get_patterns` for route/url/action extraction

3. **Cargo.toml** - Added `once_cell = "1.19"` dependency

### Performance Improvement

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Query compilations per file | 8+ | 1 (cached globally) |
| Tree traversals per PHP file | 8 | 1 |
| Expected speedup | - | ~5-10x for pattern extraction |

### Current Status

- Build: **Passing** (with some dead code warnings - expected)
- Tests: **19 tests passing**
- Ready to test in Zed

### Next Steps (for next session)

1. **Test in Zed** - Reload extensions and check new startup logs to verify performance improvement
2. **Measure actual improvement** - Compare `salsa.get_patterns` time in logs (was ~1.8s)
3. **If still slow** - Profile to find next bottleneck (could be in Salsa overhead, file I/O, etc.)
4. **Consider further optimizations**:
   - Lazy initialization of patterns (only parse when needed)
   - Background parsing on file open
   - Smaller/split query files if compilation is still slow on first use

### Key Files Modified

- `laravel-lsp/src/queries.rs` - Complete rewrite with single-pass extraction
- `laravel-lsp/src/salsa_impl.rs` - Updated to use new extraction functions
- `laravel-lsp/Cargo.toml` - Added once_cell dependency
